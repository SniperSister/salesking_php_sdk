# SalesKing PHP SDK

Automate your workflow's by integrating and connecting your business with SalesKing.
This PHP Software-Development-Kit provides solid and handy tools for building
SalesKing App's(using oAuth2) and API clients.

## Examples

Run doc/examples/* AFTER registering an app. We are providing free developer
accounts at [dev.salesking.eu/signup](https://www.dev.salesking.eu/signup/dev-gh).

To run them in your checkout directory, use the shiny new PHP build-in webserver.
[Lock at our tiny tutorial for an Ubuntu HowTo](http://dev.blog.salesking.eu/coding/run-php-webserver-in-any-directory-on-ubuntu/)

Feel free to help us add more demo code.

## Tests

Run the test with PHPUnit:
